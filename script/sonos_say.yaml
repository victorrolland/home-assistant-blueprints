blueprint:
  name: "Text-to-Speech on Sonos"
  description:
    This blueprint is used to add a script that will say messages on Sonos speakers. The script
    handles oddities to ensure a proper experience including saving/restore state, handling
    speaker groups, unmuting, pausing music, disabling repeat, adding delays, etc.

    I recommend setting the mode to parallel if you will use this script on more than one speaker.
  domain: script
  input:
    tts_service_name:
      name: Text-To-Speech Service Name
      description:
        The text-to-speech service to use when saying the message. This must match your Home
        Assistant configuration.

  volume_level:
    name: "Volume Level"
    description:
      Float for volume level. Range 0..1. If value isn't given, volume isn't changed.
      The volume will revert to the previous level after it plays the message.
    required: false

  min_wait:
    name: "Minimum Wait"
    description:
      The minimum number of seconds that the system will wait for state changes from
      Sonos. Frequently the Sonos integration reports state changes too early, misses
      some state quick enough which can result in odd volume changes, cut-off messages
      and even, when the message is very short, long delays before continuing to play
      previously running media. Setting this value will help. Defaults to 0 if not set.
